  "pain_point": "Launching all packages at once can lead to unpredictable behavior (duplicate nodes, multiple Gazebo/RViz instances, debug/demo nodes starting unintentionally).",
  "concept": "Provide a safe and predictable convention for multi-package launch.",
  "details": {
    "issue": "Blindly aggregating every launch file in the workspace (`src/*/launch/*.py`) is unsafe and noisy.",
    "solution": "Require each package to optionally define a `launch/default.launch.py`. The `genesys launch --all` command only includes these default files. Genesys scaffolds a default.launch.py automatically when creating a package.",
    "benefit": "Ensures consistency, prevents accidental over-launching, and provides a clear convention for developers. Keeps Genesys ergonomic but predictable."
